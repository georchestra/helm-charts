# WARNING: New structure for the Helm charts

The geOrchestra helm is now under a subfolder and the GitHub repository name has changed.

- Make sure to change the git remote if you are using the helm chart as a submodule. And now point to the subfolder "georchestra".

- When using OCI, change from:  
  ```
  oci://ghcr.io/georchestra/helm-georchestra/georchestra
  ```
  to:
  ```
  oci://ghcr.io/georchestra/helm-charts/georchestra
  ```
